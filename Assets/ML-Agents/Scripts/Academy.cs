/**
 * Welcome to Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents).
 *
 * The ML-Agents toolkit contains four entities: Academy, Agent, Communicator and
 * Python API. The academy and connected agents live within
 * a learning environment (herein called Environment), while the communicator
 * manages the communication between the learning environment and the Python
 * API. For more information on each of these entities, in addition to how to
 * set-up a learning environment and train the behavior of characters in a
 * Unity scene, please browse our documentation pages on GitHub:
