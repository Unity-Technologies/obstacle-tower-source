    /// user in <see cref="CollectObservations"/>. On the other hand, actions
    /// are determined by decisions produced by a Policy. Currently, this
    /// class is expected to be extended to implement the desired agent behavior.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Simply speaking, an agent roams through an environment and at each step
    /// of the environment extracts its current observation, sends them to its
    /// policy and in return receives an action. In practice,
    /// however, an agent need not send its observation at every step since very
    /// little may have changed between successive steps.
    ///
    /// At any step, an agent may be considered <see cref="m_Done"/>.
    /// This could occur due to a variety of reasons:
    ///     - The agent reached an end state within its environment.
    ///     - The agent reached the maximum # of steps (i.e. timed out).
    ///     - The academy reached the maximum # of steps (forced agent to be done).
    ///
    /// Here, an agent reaches an end state if it completes its task successfully
    /// or somehow fails along the way. In the case where an agent is done before
    /// the academy, it either resets and restarts, or just lingers until the
    /// academy is done.
    ///
    /// An important note regarding steps and episodes is due. Here, an agent step
    /// corresponds to an academy step, which also corresponds to Unity
    /// environment step (i.e. each FixedUpdate call). This is not the case for
    /// episodes. The academy controls the global episode count and each agent
    /// controls its own local episode count and can reset and start a new local
    /// episode independently (based on its own experience). Thus an academy
    /// (global) episode can be viewed as the upper-bound on an agents episode
    /// length and that within a single global episode, an agent may have completed
    /// multiple local episodes. Consequently, if an agent max step is
    /// set to a value larger than the academy max steps value, then the academy
    /// value takes precedence (since the agent max step will never be reached).
    ///
    /// Lastly, note that at any step the policy to the agent is allowed to
    /// change model with <see cref="GiveModel"/>.
    ///
    /// Implementation-wise, it is required that this class is extended and the
    /// virtual methods overridden. For sample implementations of agent behavior,
    /// see the Examples/ directory within this Unity project.
